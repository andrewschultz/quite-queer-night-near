>get sheet
The sheep sheet feels a bit cold. You could take it anyway, but maybe you can do something to warm it up first.

>get sheet
A chill runs through your body. A voice whispers "You'll never achieve the maximum score." This makes you feel bad, until you remember escape is the most important thing.

(OPTIONAL) You can go back to Blight Blear Bight Bier to HEAP HEAT on the cheap cheat sheep sheet.

That's not a verb this (stripped down) parser recognizes, and it doesn't contain any magic. Maybe there's a bit more to find here, though.
You can also type VERBS for a list of valid verbs (it can change as you gain or lose hint items) or ABOUT to see general information.

#testcase-check-vc-fight-fear-rule-fallthrough
You do your best to feel braver. It works, well enough! The Drink Drug Think Thug seems a bit less tough now, and what do you know? The spite spear vanishes, too!

#testcase-check-vc-fight-fear-rule-if-sco-fight-fear-is-true

Yes, fighting fear is a lifelong journey, but fighting too hard all at once will bring it back.

>heap heat

#testcase-check-vc-heap-heat-rule-fallthrough
You rub your hands together for warmth, blow on the sheet, and so on. And what do you know? It stays less frigid after you pick it up. It'd still be technically functional at any temperature, but now it won't freeze your fingers if you carry it around.
What's more, if you don't understand how it works, you can spoil things with DEEP DEET.

>pink pug

#testcase-check-vc-pink-pug-rule-fallthrough
POOF! The drink-drug think-thug turns into a far more innocuous pink pug, which runs off, yapping.

That's not a verb this (stripped down) parser recognizes, and it doesn't contain any magic. Maybe get up those stair stones, somehow.
Since you have the sheep sheet handy, you can CC something. You can also type VERBS for a list of valid verbs (it can change as you gain or lose hint items) or ABOUT to see general information.

>deep duel
by one point

#testcase-check-vc-deep-duel-rule-fallthrough
There is no progress without conflict. You look into the peep pool and wait for an opponent to show. A crash from the steep stool to the east indicates someone has arrived for a deep duel: a creep, cruel!
Maybe if you defeat them, you'll be able to go east. But right now, being around them is just annoying.

#testcase-check-vc-deep-duel-rule-if-creep-cruel-is-not-off-stage
>deep duel
You already summoned the creep (cruel).

>deep dual
Summoning the creep (cruel) was enough.

>dual deep
Summoning the creep (cruel) was enough.

>keep cool
by one point

#testcase-check-vc-keep-cool-rule-fallthrough
You manage to ignore the creep (cruel) as they get more and more desperate to insult you. Eventually, they explain you're not worth the effort, and also you are probably too callous and selfish to care about the next person they'll need to insult even worse.

#testcase-check-vc-keep-cool-rule-if-creep-cruel-is-moot

You don't need to keep cool any more.

A bark bump appears to the north! You weren't going that way, but it provides a bit of a channel.

#testcase-check-vc-stark-stump-rule-fallthrough
Poof! A stark stump appears! It blocks the way to the west, but it provides a channel in case anything would come flowing through.

>park pump

#testcase-check-vc-park-pump-rule-fallthrough
Poof! A park pump appears, just like you remember as a kid! It appears to be auto-pumping, creating a waterway. With the stark stump and bark bump sealing off two exits, water flows freely back south.

#testcase-check-vc-bark-bump-rule-if-sco-bark-bump-is-true

#testcase-check-vc-plaster-plate-rule-fallthrough
A huge chunk of the gaster gate breaks off and creates a plaster plate. It's much too big to eat off, but it crumbles quickly apart (probably not Last 'Er Late brand) and is washed away beyond the dark dump. The Master Mate, their job done, smiles, gives a thumbs up, and walks away.

Yum! Or not. You find a firkin or flagon or whatever of old ale, and it doesn't taste very good, but it's nourishing and hopefully not too alcoholic.

If you were trying to get drunk, more old ale would be the way to do it. But you're trying to get FREE.
