Sorry, I can't do anything with that. This is a sort of guess-the-verb game. Examining and directions are the main commands. Point scoring actions are verbs to guess, and there is a theme to them.

>pink pug

The gunky material flowing back to Stair Stones is icky, but it will help patch them up even more. You run back quickly. It takes a while, and it's not art, but you do your best. Once it dries, the way up looks traversable.
