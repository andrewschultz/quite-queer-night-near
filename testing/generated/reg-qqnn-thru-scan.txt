>deep deet
You pore through all the items the sheet has information on. You cross-compare them and make hypotheses. You check for contradictions and inconsistencies in the data. It takes a while, but you come up with the following:

/== means the desired object or action has the same number of letters in each word as the original object or room.
-- means the desired object or action has less letters in each word than the original object or room.
