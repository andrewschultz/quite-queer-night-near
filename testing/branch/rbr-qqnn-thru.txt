}$REJECT1=Sorry, I can't do anything with that. This is a sort of guess-the-verb game. Examining and directions are the main commands. Point scoring actions are verbs to guess, and there is a theme to them.
}$REJECT2=That's not a verb this (stripped down) parser recognizes, and it doesn't contain any magic. Maybe there's a bit more to find here, though.

Yum! Or not. You find a firkin or flagon or whatever of old ale, and it doesn't taste very good, but it's nourishing and hopefully not too alcoholic.

If you were trying to get drunk, more old ale would be the way to do it. But you're trying to get FREE.

Yeah, that's it. You've had your fun. Time to move on. As you leave, you notice some fey foam. You're obviously meant to do something with it, so you build a day dome before a nay-gnome appears. You enter it and say the magic words: HEY, HOME.
Your adventures are just silly enough and just believable enough to scare friends or to laugh at things.
BAH?! BOO-YAH, YOU!
