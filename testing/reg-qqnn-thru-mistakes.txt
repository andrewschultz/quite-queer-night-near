> kite keyer
refer to the sheep sheet
You don't need the risk of getting zapped by electricity, too.
> might mere
refer to the sheep sheet
You'd still be scared, reducing your antagonist's strength. You'd be scared of even losing to them. What can you do to stop being scared?
> skite skier
refer to the sheep sheet
Too archaic, and you would gain no joy seeing someone else mess up.
> plight pleaer
refer to the sheep sheet
Seeing someone else scared and begging won't help you.
> sprite spreer
refer to the sheep sheet
Chugging pop will not help in your present circumstances.
> trite treer
refer to the sheep sheet
You don't need anything to be chasing you up a tree, hackneyed or otherwise.
> bite bier
refer to the sheep sheet
You don't need homonyms here. Something else... something a bit more common...
> flight fleer
You need to get less scared, not more. Plus, there's nowhere to run, anyway.
> light leer
No, facial expressions aren't enough, here. Especially expressions of contempt.
> height here
How physically low or high you are isn't important. It's the mental bit.
> right rear
You are right in the rear, but you need to move on.
> shite sheer
Getting mad doesn't necessarily help here.
> sight seer
Yes, you're a sight seer.
> smite smear
sheep sheet
You don't need violence or a battle cry.
> white wier
No fence appears.
> tight tier
You think up all the formal and informal meanings of the word tight, but nothing pops up.
> beep beat
You imagine an eternity spent listening to funky techno music. Scary!
> creep crete
You fail to hyperwarp across the Mediterranean.
> leap leet
You take a giant step towards understanding a tricky science concept from high school.
> peep peat
refer to the sheep sheet
The ground around you remains hard.
> streep street
Stalking an actress is scary, yes, but we're not going for that sort of scary.
> sweep suite
Neither a favorite team's success nor drudgery will get your mind off things.
> weep wheat
The ground remains unarable.
> meep meat
refer to the sheep sheet
No roadrunner whizzes by, and neither does a devious, planning coyote.
> deep deet
refer to the sheep sheet
You can't see any deep details, but maybe when you take the sheet...
> neep neat
refer to the sheep sheet
You see no turnip turn up.
> seep seat
refer to the sheep sheet
What on earth would you do with a leaky chair?
> hath haven
!refer to the sheep sheet
You don't want to let the maven escape. It could help you! Once you're free, you can set it free.
> chink chug
refer to the sheep sheet
The Drink Drug Think Thug is too large to disappear through any crack. You're too large to escape
> jink jug
refer to the sheep sheet
No liquid container to help your dexterity appears. Oh, well. It might've jinked YOU, anyway.
> fink fug
refer to the sheep sheet
No fog carries the Drink Drug Think Thug away or even makes it wimpier.
> link lug
refer to the sheep sheet
You need to make the thug much less intimidating.
> mink mug
refer to the sheep sheet
The Think Thug is too smart to be upset for being called a rat-face or whatever.
> rink rug
refer to the sheep sheet
A rug would be out of place inside a roller rink or ice skating rink. Still, it was worth a try.
> shrink shrug
sheep sheet
A shrug would not shrink the Drink Drug Think Thug by much. Perhaps there is something you can shrink it into, so it can't possibly be anywhere near as big as you.
> slink slug
refer to the sheep sheet
Perhaps that is a bit too drastic. Another more likable animal might work great, though.

No roadrunner whizzes by, and neither does a devious, planning coyote.
> deep deet
!refer to the sheep sheet
You pore through all the items the sheet has information on. You cross-compare them and make hypotheses. You check for contradictions and inconsistencies in the data. It takes a while, but you come up with the following:

Bare Bones Stair Stones

> air owns
!sheep sheet
The air is everywhere, and it'd take too long to own up to all your mistakes.
> bear bones
!sheep sheet
That would make for creepier ambience, but more importantly, the bear bones would make the stair stones even tougher to climb.
> care cones
!sheep sheet
Nothing appears to make you feel more loved. Aww.
> crayer crones
!sheep sheet
Not only is that a stretch, but it would actively hurt your quest.
> fair phones
!sheep sheet
You have no outside communication here.
> grayer groans
!sheep sheet
A little more atmosphere doesn't help, but it doesn't hurt, either.
> mare moans
!sheep sheet
Horses whinny in the distance.
> pear pwns
!sheep sheet
You don't need any material items, or to win an argument, to escape.
> rare roans
!sheep sheet
Bringing horses into this mess would be animal cruelty.
> scare scones
!sheep sheet
Spooky food is a creative idea here, but maybe not a practical one.
!sheep sheet
> stare stones
!sheep sheet
Nothing appears in the stones. You would need to repair them to climb them.
> clayer clones
!sheep sheet
No golems appear to try and build the stairs. But on the bright side, none appear from the stairs to make it tougher to go up.
> hair hones
!sheep sheet
This is no time for follicular or lagomorphic care!
> jer jones
!sheep sheet
The owner of the Dallas Cowboys is nightmarish in his own way, though yes, it might be fun to stick him in a nightmare.
> tare tones
!sheep sheet
No more scary noises than needed, please.

Peep Pool

> jeep jewel
refer to the sheep sheet
The jeep would probably run over YOU.
> reap rule
refer to the sheep sheet
This adventure is about surviving, not taking over.
> weep wool
refer to the sheep sheet
Crying is out. So are nice new warm clothes. You're on a spooky Halloween adventure, here!
> deep dual
refer to the sheep sheet
You are very close. You don't need to make the pool deeper, but you need something else deep
> dual deep
refer to the sheep sheet
You are very close. You don't need to make the pool deeper, but you need something else deep.

Gore Gulch

> boar bulge
refer to the sheep sheet
That's a bit of a stretch, but Gore Gulch remains unstretched.

>more mulch

/^Stair Stones
The gunky material flowing back to Bare Bones Stair Stones is icky, but it will help patch them up. You run back quickly. It takes a while, and it's not art, but you do your best. Once it dries, the way up looks almost traversable.

>u
The stones are almost climbable but still too risky. You need to do a bit more.

Dark Dump

> ark ump
sheep sheet
Nobody appears to decide which animals will be doomed to forty days and nights of floods.
> clark clump
refer to the sheep sheet
Clark Griswold does not appear in a heap.
> lark lump
refer to the sheep sheet
Eww, dead birds?
> mark mump
refer to the sheep sheet
With just one mump, you might drive yourself up the wall wondering if you are half-sick or half-well.

Gaster Gate

> faster fate
refer to the sheep sheet
But that might mean a faster BAD fate as well as a good one.
> hastur hate
refer to the sheep sheet
Oh no. You don't need to make things worse.
> laster late
refer to the sheep sheet
A good try, if un-grammatical. But you already have lasted, and you don't want your obstacles to last.
> raster rate
refer to the sheep sheet
Your text adventure remains totally texty.

Lair 'Lone's Stair Stones
The gunky material flowing back to Stair Stones is icky, but it will help patch them up even more. You run back quickly. It takes a while, and it's not art, but you do your best. Once it dries, the way up looks traversable.

Gold Gaol

> rolled rail
refer to the sheep sheet
You don't need assistance getting out. Or a need to rail verbally.
> bold bail
refer to the sheep sheet
You don't have to be bold. The gaol is unguarded.
> doled dale
refer to the sheep sheet
That's a bit too archaic to be a final solution, but ... you do dream about these sorts of things in prison.
> fold fail
refer to the sheep sheet
You look at FOLD FAIL on the wall, hoping for the wrath ravin' math maven to get exasperated enough to spill a solution. But apparently it's good at passive-aggressiveness, too!
> hold hail
refer to the sheep sheet
There is nobody to summon, and you don't want to summon weather, either.
> mold male
refer to the sheep sheet
You uncover no old letters checking on how you are. Not surprising. You've only been here a bit.
> polled pail
refer to the sheep sheet
You haven't been here long enough to even want the company of a pollster.
> scold scale
refer to the sheep sheet
The scold scale is probably something you get BEFORE you are sent to prison.
> sold sail
refer to the sheep sheet
You don't have to buy anything. You don't want to.
> swolled swale
refer to the sheep sheet
The gold gaol cannot change THAT drastically.
> tolled tail
sheep sheet
That must be very close indeed.
> trolled trail
refer to the sheep sheet
You will have to make your own trail out. Make it enough yours, you could recount it to others.
> wold wail
refer to the sheep sheet
Nothing too drastic, here.

> gold gale
refer to the sheep sheet
You can't change the gaol. You can escape easily enough. You just need to figure how, comfortably.
