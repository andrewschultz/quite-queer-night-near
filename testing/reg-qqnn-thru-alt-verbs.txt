/^Stair Stones
The gunky material flowing back to Bare Bones Stair Stones is icky, but it will help patch them up. You run back quickly. It takes a while, and it's not art, but you do your best. Once it dries, the way up looks almost traversable.

Lair 'Lone's Stair Stones
The gunky material flowing back to Stair Stones is icky, but it will help patch them up even more. You run back quickly. It takes a while, and it's not art, but you do your best. Once it dries, the way up looks traversable.
