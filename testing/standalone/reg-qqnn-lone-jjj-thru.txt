Sorry, I can't do anything with that. This is a sort of guess-the-verb game. Examining and directions are the main commands. Point scoring actions are verbs to guess, and there is a theme to them.
Since you have the sheep sheet handy, you can CC something. You can also type VERBS for a list of valid verbs (it can change as you gain or lose hint items) or ABOUT to see general information.

>pp
This is the hint/move-ahead command, but you don't have your hinting assistant, yet.

The wrath ravin' math maven looks slightly offended and half-heartedly tugs you in the direction of the sheep sheet, as if it's not really necessary to have TWO hint aids. Try for the sheet anyway?

The wrath ravin' math maven groans and struggles from your grasp and runs off. Maybe more good guesses will bring it back.
>undo
The wrath ravin' math maven zips back in, running backwards. It doesn't look pleased at your little stunt, but you're bigger than it, so it can't stop you.

>pp
The wrath ravin' math maven squawks and taps its head, as if to indicate you're forgetting something. (THINK may show what.) Use the maven's help anyway?

>undo
The math maven howls at your parser-subverting trickery, but what can it do? It doesn't know any destructive magic. You'd think it'd be happy with growing a little bigger, but noooo.

The wrath ravin' math maven ran off because you used it up, but maybe good guesses will bring it back.
