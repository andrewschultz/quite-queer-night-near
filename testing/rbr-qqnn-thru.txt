@mis
> flight fleer
You need to get less scared, not more.
> light leer
No, facial expressions aren't enough, here. Especially expressions of contempt.
> height here
How physically low or high you are isn't important. It's the mental bit.
> right rear
You are right in the rear, but you need to move on.
> shite sheer
Getting mad doesn't necessarily help here.
> sight seer
Yes, you're a sight seer.
> white wier
No fence appears.
> tight tier
You think up all the formal and informal meanings of the word tight, but nothing pops up.
> beep beat
You imagine an eternity spent listening to funky techno music. Scary!
> creep crete
You fail to hyperwarp across the Mediterranean.
> leap leet
You take a giant step towards understanding a tricky science concept from high school.
> sleep sleet
You don't need anything raining down on you.
> streep street
Stalking an actress is scary, yes, but we're not going for that sort of scary.
> sweep suite
Neither a favorite team's success nor drudgery will get your mind off things.
> weep wheat
The ground remains unarable.
> fink fug
sheep sheet
No fog carries the Drink Drug Think Thug away or even makes it wimpier.
> link lug
sheep sheet
You need to make the thug much less intimidating.
> mink mug
sheep sheet
The Think Thug is too smart to be upset for being called a rat-face or whatever.
> rink rug
sheep sheet
A rug would be out of place inside a roller rink or ice skating rink. Still, it was worth a try.
> slink slug
sheep sheet
Perhaps that is a bit too drastic. Another more likable animal might work great, though.

Bare Bones Stair Stones

@mis
> care cones
sheep sheet
Nothing appears to make you feel more loved. Aww.
> crayer crones
sheep sheet
Not only is that a stretch, but it would actively hurt your quest.
> fair phones
sheep sheet
You have no outside communication here.
> grayer grones
sheep sheet
A little more atmosphere doesn't help, but it doesn't hurt, either.
> scare scones
sheep sheet
Spooky food is a creative idea here, but maybe not a practical one.
> mare moans
sheep sheet
Horses whinny in the distance.
> rare roans
sheep sheet
Bringing horses into this mess would be animal cruelty.

Gore Gulch

@mis

sheep sheet
That's a bit of a stretch, but Gore Gulch remains unstretched.

Dark Dump

@mis
> clark clump
sheep sheet
Clark Griswold does not appear in a heap.
> lark lump
sheep sheet
Eww, dead birds?
> mark mump
sheep sheet
You don't want half a sickness, even a temporary one.

@mis
> faster fate
sheep sheet
But that might mean a faster BAD fate as well as a good one.
> hastur hate
sheep sheet
Oh no. You don't need to make things worse.
> laster late
sheep sheet
A good try, if un-grammatical. But you already have lasted, and you don't want your obstacles to last.
> raster rate
sheep sheet
Your text adventure remains totally texty.

Gold Gaol

@mis
> bold bail
sheep sheet
You don't have to be bold. The gaol is unguarded.
> doled dale
sheep sheet
That's a bit too archaic to be a final solution, but ... you do dream about these sorts of things in prison.
> fold fail
sheep sheet
You don't have to be bold. The gaol is unguarded.
> hold hail
sheep sheet
There is nobody to summon, and you don't want to summon weather, either.
> mold male
sheep sheet
You uncover no old letters checking on how you are. Not surprising. You've only been here a bit.
> polled pail
sheep sheet
You haven't been here long enough to even want the company of a pollster.
> scold scale
sheep sheet
The scold scale is probably something you get BEFORE you are sent to prison.
> sold sail
sheep sheet
You don't have to buy anything. You don't want to.
> swolled swale
sheep sheet
The gold gaol cannot change THAT drastically.
> trolled trail
sheep sheet
You will have to make your own trail out. Make it enough yours, you could recount it to others.
> wold wail
sheep sheet
Nothing too drastic, here.
