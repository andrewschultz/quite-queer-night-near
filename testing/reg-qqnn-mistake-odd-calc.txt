Thwup! You hear a sound...and notice a small humanoid something rustling in. From its esoteric babble, you deduce it is a wrath ravin' math maven! It resists as you pick it up, but you're too big. You realize it could help you move ahead on a tricky rhyme, at the right place at the right time, with PATH PAVIN (PP).

Lump charges = 1.

The wrath ravin' math maven howls and grows bigger. All your guesses have paid off.

No, facial expressions aren't enough, here. Especially expressions of contempt.
> height here
How physically low or high you are isn't important. It's the mental bit.

You are right in the rear, but you need to move on.

Yes, you're a sight seer.

sheep sheet
A rug would be out of place inside a roller rink or ice skating rink. Still, it was worth a try.
> slink slug

Perhaps that is a bit too drastic. Another more likable animal might work great, though.

Bare Bones Stair Stones

@mis
> bear bones
!sheep sheet
That would make for creepier ambience, but more importantly, the bear bones would make the stair stones even tougher to climb.

Nothing appears in the stones. You/can just/have a bit more work before you/would need to repair them to/climb them.

The stones are nowhere near in climbable condition yet.

/^Stair Stones
The gunky material flowing back to Stair Stones is icky, but it will help patch them up. You run back quickly. It takes a while, and it's not art, but you do your best. Once it dries, the way up looks almost traversable.

>u
The stones are almost climbable but still too risky. You need to do a bit more.

Gold Gaol

@mis

sheep sheet
You don't have to be bold. The gaol is unguarded.
> doled dale
sheep sheet
That's a bit too archaic to be a final solution, but ... you do dream about these sorts of things in prison.
> fold fail
sheep sheet
You look at FOLD FAIL on the wall, hoping for the lump to maybe grow a bit brighter. It does not. Poor you!
> hold hail

There is nobody to summon, and you don't want to summon weather, either.

You uncover no old letters checking on how you are. Not surprising. You've only been here a bit.
