Thwup! You hear a sound...and notice a small humanoid something rustling in. From its esoteric babble, you deduce it is a wrath ravin' math maven! It resists as you pick it up, but you're too big. You realize it could help you move ahead on a tricky rhyme, at the right place at the right time, with PATH PAVIN (PP).
