This is a walkthrough for Quite Queer Night Near. It contains spoilers.

The basic object is to form the Bare Bones Stair Stones into something more, climb up, and escape the Gold Gaol.

The first point we'll get is a bonus point. You can take the cheap cheat sheep sheet, which just means you don't get a bonus point, or you can get it another way.

How to use the sheet is detailed at the end of the document, spoiler-free except for mentioning which room has multiple puzzles, but brute-forcing your way through is also valid, and in such a small game, it might be more efficient.

> HEAP HEAT

(An alternative here is a BLEEP BLEAT. Whichever one you choose makes no difference.)

Now to get less scared. There are actually two ways to do this.

> FIGHT FEAR

(FRIGHT FREER is less obvious, but it's still valid. Again, whichever one you choose makes no difference.)

Now you can take on the Drink Drug Think Thug.

> PINK PUG

> E

It doesn't matter which way you go first.

> S

The steep stool blocks your way east.

> DEEP DUEL

The alternative here is to summon CREEP CRUEL directly.

> KEEP COOL

Now you can go east.

What to do or create in Gore Gulch?

> MORE MULCH

The mulch slides back to the stones, where you patch things up a bit, but you can't quite climb the stairs yet. You need a bit more. Have a look north.

> N

The dark dump can be so much more. Three things more, in particular.

> PARK PUMP

This gets water flowing, but the pump stops. The stream it created has nowhere to go and nothing to carry.

> STARK STUMP

Now you almost have a corridor.

> BARK BUMP

(Again, there is an alternate equally functional solution here: HARK HUMP.)

Now you really do have a corridor. But you need something to float in the stream.

> E

The Master Mate is just there for a hint. So how can you get rid of the Gaster Gate, or part of it?

> PLASTER PLATE

Again, you're kicked back to the stairs stones, but now you can go up!

> U

Hunger. Thirst. How to cure each, or both?

> OLD ALE

> COLD KALE

You need put everything behind you.

> TOLD TALE

Yay! You win.





































The cheap cheat sheep sheet has settings such as ++, ==, --, +=, =+, -=, =-, and ??. What do they mean?

You can say DEEP DEET once you have the sheet, or there's an explanation below.

== is the most likely one. It says that the desired rhyme pair has two words of the same length as the initial rhyme pair. +=/=+ means one of the two desired rhymes is longer. -=/=- means one is shorter. +- is less likely to see, but it means a shorter and longer rhyme.

?? is the trickiest. But it happens in the case of the Gold Gaol, where you have two things you need to do. One is ==, and one is --. But neither one must come first. A more detailed example is the Dark Dump. One rhyme is ++, and the other two are ==. So you will get ?? until you convert the ++.
